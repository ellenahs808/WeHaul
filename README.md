Splash page -> pretty much done - needs styling
login -> pretty much done - needs styling


CSS styling all over the place

User Page:
    1. Form
       get input working. 
        Parse data for google maps request.
    2. View pending request
        Job index filtered on User Id
    3. cancel request
        delete job through delete job prop.
        

Driver Page:
    1. View all requests
        render map with origin pins and data. 
    2. accept request -> Assign session user ID to driverId
    3. display accepted request on map -> filter map based off of currently accepted request if there is one.
        render map with dest and origin info instead of origin pins and data.
    4. remove request? -> remove filter and remove Driver ID from Job. -> render all requests.
